            <h2>Where the Idea Began</h2>
            <p>As an 11th grade student, I often noticed how much class time is spent telling students their grades. I realized this time could be used much more efficiently. That's when I thought of <span class="highlight">EduPrishtina</span>: a platform where students can instantly view their grades online and stay updated on their academic progress.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Purpose</h2>
            <p>High school is a critical stage before college, and knowing where you stand academically can make a huge difference. By offering easy access to grades, schedules, and statistics, students can prepare more effectively. For teachers, this platform allows secure updates and tracking of student performance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>EduPrishtina is designed for both <span class="highlight">students</span> and <span class="highlight">teachers</span>. Verified users can access personalized features: students see their grades, while teachers can edit, filter, and view statistics of their students. Teachers only have access to the schools they are associated with, ensuring privacy and organization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Verification Matters</h2>
            <p>Anyone can register on EduPrishtina, but only verified users get full access. If someone logs in but cannot use school-specific features, it means they are pending verification by the admin. To be verified, users must send an email using their sign-up email, attaching birth certificates (theirs and their parents') and provide their school, address, and grade level (10th, 11th, or 12th).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Future Potential</h2>
            <p>This is just the beginning. EduPrishtina could evolve to include features for parents, specific subject teachers, and even school directors. It could become a national educational tool that transforms how we manage school data â€” a digital upgrade that could put Kosovo on the map for educational innovation.</p>
